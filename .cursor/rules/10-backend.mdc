description: Backend rules: endpoints must match ticket contract; add minimal tests/logging.
globs:
  - "server.py"
  - "**/*.py"
alwaysApply: false

Backend rules:
- Do not change API response shapes unless ticket explicitly updates the contract.
- Timestamps: always ms unix epoch.
- Return explicit errors with message + status code.
- Prefer deterministic behavior for tests and local runs.
